            As a deliberate policy, our advertisement campaign has been by word of mouth of parents 
            as we strive to meet their aspirations and those of their wards/children. 
            We have continued to compete favourably in inter-school competitions and with schools 
            that have existed long before us. This has been possible because of our continuous 
            improvement approach to child development, the learning resources and infrastructure that we deploy.
